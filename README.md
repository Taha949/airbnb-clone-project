## üóÉÔ∏è Database Design

### üîë Key Entities

1. **Users**
   - `id`, `name`, `email`, `password_hash`, `created_at`
   - A user can own multiple properties and make multiple bookings.

2. **Properties**
   - `id`, `title`, `description`, `location`, `owner_id`
   - Each property is owned by a user and can have multiple bookings and reviews.

3. **Bookings**
   - `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `status`
   - A booking links a user to a property for a specific time period.

4. **Reviews**
   - `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `rating`, `comment`, `created_at`
   - Users can leave reviews for properties they‚Äôve booked.

5. **Payments**
   - `id`, `booking_id`, `amount`, `payment_method`, `status`, `timestamp`
   - Each payment is tied to a booking and tracks transaction details.

### üîó Relationships

- A **user** can own many **properties**
- A **property** can have many **bookings** and **reviews**
- A **booking** belongs to one **user** and one **property**
- A **payment** is linked to one **booking**

  Handles registration, login, profile updates, and session control. Ensures secure access and personalized experiences.

- **Property Management**  
  Allows users to list, edit, and delete properties. Includes image uploads, amenities, and location tagging.

- **Booking System**

## üîê API Security

### Key Measures

- **Authentication**: Secure login using JWT or OAuth to verify user identity.
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control to restrict sensitive operations.
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse by limiting requests per user/IP.
- **Input Validation**: Sanitizes user input to prevent SQL injection and XSS.
- **HTTPS Encryption**: Ensures secure data transmission between client and server.

### Why It Matters

- Protects sensitive user data like passwords and payment info  
- Prevents unauthorized access to admin or property management features  
- Secures financial transactions and booking records  
- Builds trust and compliance with data protection standards

## üîÑ CI/CD Pipeline

### What Is CI/CD?

CI/CD stands for **Continuous Integration** and **Continuous Deployment** ‚Äî a development practice that automates testing, building, and deploying code changes.

### Why It‚Äôs Important

- Speeds up development cycles  
- Reduces human error during deployment  
- Ensures consistent environments across staging and production  
- Enables rapid feedback and rollback if needed

### Tools to Use

- **GitHub Actions**: Automates testing and deployment workflows
